# SimplEngine
## Description
Boilerplate code for Pygame which intends to provide developers some utility when developing their Pygame projects. 

Originally this was intended to be a snake game, but I ended up writing more boilerplate code than actual gameplay. 

Some of this was developed with a particular school project in mind. There may be some certain odd design choices due to this - if I keep maintaining this project in Python then I will iron these out later on. However, I have been considering switching this project over to Rust once I have a better grasp of that language.

### Features
- Textures
- Sprites
- Hitboxes
- Object groups
- Input management 
- Scene management

### Planned
- UI elements
    - Buttons
    - Labels
    - Text Input
    - Radio Button
    - Checkboxes

- Collision detection
    - Circles
    - Boxes

- RNG/Noise
    - Perlin Noise
    - Wave function collapse

## Use
Unlike some game-related Python projects, you don't import this into your Python file. 

Simply clone the boilerplate code, and get rid of anything you don't need. Then you can start working on your game by modifying the files.

The engine is licensed under MIT, feel free to modify this boilerplate to target specific genres/types of games, and redistribute.
